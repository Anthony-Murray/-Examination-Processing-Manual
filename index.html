                <p>This can be temporarily fixed to let school office print off the broadsheet but changes will need to be reverted back after they are printed:</p>

                <p><em>Awards class will now show on broadsheet. Advise school: It is temporarily fixed. If you would let me know when you have printed the Broadsheet off, as I need to revert the changes back on the system to ensure this student is on Ratification list for graduation. I am going to leave this ticket open so you can let me know when Broadsheets are printed?</em></p>
                <p>When school confirm they have printed broadsheets, follow same steps as above but changing back to Y3 in Attribute Code.</p>

            <h2>Award GPA Missing (NNMTL_8)</h2>
            <p>Award GPA will not appear on broadsheet (SEP) as the module the student repeated wasn't part of the Award calculation / not in the award area. The Award GPA will appear on the result list that goes to Academic Council and will appear on the transcript.</p>
            <p>In this case, the award GPA will need to be handwritten onto Broadsheet.</p>

            <h2>Award Missing - Student is Missing from June Line on Broadsheet</h2>
            <h3>Reasons for Term Line Missing from Broadsheet:</h3>
            <p>If the student is missing June line in the broadsheet, they could be on a yearlong programme that runs over 2 semesters (Starts in January, ends in December). They appear on the broadsheet as year 2 student, when the rest students are year 1. The year will need to change from year 2 back to year one.</p>
            <h3>Steps to Fix:</h3>

            </ol>
            <p><em>Note: If the award year doesn't appear for student, could be wrong year in attributes, make sure it is current academic year in attribute. Make sure that information in student attributes and cohort corresponds with SFAREGS. If a student completed their final year but had a repeat module from a previous year, which they retook during the August session, the award classification will not appear in the broadsheet because the module is from second year while the student is listed as third year. In this case, the student's attributes and cohort need to be changed to second year, and a pre-broadsheet load should be run.</em></p>

            <h3>Steps to Check and Fix:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Is compliance met /Grade is entered and rolled? (<strong>SMICRLT</strong>)</li>
                <li>Are all modules registered in (<strong>SFAREGS</strong>)? Take Screenshot of list of modules as reference.</li>
                <li>Check the student Catalog Term (<strong>SGASTDN</strong> -- Curriculum Tab -- take note of catalog term & Programme name (i.e., DK_IMILM_8_YR4).</li>
                <li>Compare the module(s) are the same from SFAREGS are listed in the Area for the students Catalog Term, you can check this in (<strong>SMAAREA</strong>)? Page down x5 (Take note of "From Term")</li>

            <p><em>If there are modules missing from list in SMAAREA compared to your list in SFAREGS & the "From Term" is dated after student Catalog Term, this means that the Programme has changed and the student does not meet compliance as they have a different Catalog Term.</em></p>

            <p>Laura Byrne Year 4 General Nursing D00212401 Deferred her Internship Module PLCE N8143 in 2021/2022 on the old programme code DK_NPNUR_8. Can she be registered to the Deferred CRN 76669?</p>
            <h3>Reply from Olly:</h3>
            <p>If the student is DX, then they are normally put on the old programme. There would have to be an agreement that the student could transfer to a whole new programme, and adjustments etc have to be done. I did one yesterday that Sinead asked me to on this programme but she said that it was agreed to allow that other student to graduate on the new programme. Basically, without proper consideration etc they can't just change a student's programme. DX and RX are always put on the "old" CRN and consequently they are on the original programme.</p>
            <h3>Confirmed from School:</h3>
            <p>They DO NOT want her to graduate on new programme but still won't let you register CRN, follow below steps:</p>

                <p>A module can have up to 3 components, for example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Final Exam</li>
            <li>Continuous Assessment</li>
            <li>Practical</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The student is graded per component, which will make up the full module grade. If compliance is not met OR registering repeat modules for a student, you can check the components of the module.</p>
        <h3>Steps to Check Components:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>SHAGCOM</strong></li>
            <li>Enter current Term</li>
            <li>Enter CRN</li>
            <li>GO</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You can also check components through <strong>SHACRSE</strong>:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>SHACRSE</strong></li>
            <li>Student number</li>
            <li>Leave Term Blank</li>
            <li>GO</li>
            <li>Select the magnifying glass icon to the left of the module you wish to check</li>
            <li>Below Course Detail, select "Components"</li>

    <!-- Doing Adjustments on Individual Subjects -->
    <section id="doing-adjustments-on-individual-subjects">
        <h2>Doing Adjustments on Individual Subjects</h2>
        <p>Run the Wrapper for the Current Term. If a student is not meeting Compliance for a stage, or they are missing certain subjects (it is best to do this on a stage-by-stage basis):</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Check <strong>SGASTDN</strong> for the current Catalog Term.</li>
            <li>Note the Catalog Term that the student sat the area not meeting compliance.</li>
            <li>Run Compliance for that Area (in most cases, if there is only one Catalog Term, then you don't need to bother running compliance, as it has to be that Catalog Term).</li>
            <li>Check that the student has 60 credits in Courses Used.</li>
            <li>If they have 60 credits there, use that CAT Term for Adjustment.</li>
            <li>Check if they have the subjects in <strong>SHACRSE</strong> but are missing them in <strong>SMICRLT</strong> -- this usually indicates the Adjustment required (quite often this is a student who is doing a subject that isn't on the APS but HoD has agreed it can be counted).</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Individual Course Adjustment:</h3>
        <p><em>Be EXTREMELY careful and ensure any adjustments made are correct and have been approved by the Exam Board.</em></p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>SMASARA</strong></li>
            <li>Enter Student ID, <strong>current</strong> Catalog Term, and Area you want to Adjust.</li>

            <li>Options, Default All</li>
            <li>Type in Area & Area Term (this is the Catalog Term that you want the system to make the adjustment from). If you get an error here, check through the "Default from Area" and see what Catalog Terms are attached to the Area. It may be a Catalog term from the year before if there was no change to the ACS.</li>
            <li>Click Process Default</li>
            <li>Next Block</li>
            <li>Click on <strong>Course Attachment</strong> to see all the courses you have now attached to the student.</li>
            <li>Add or remove courses as necessary (F6 to add; Shift & F6 to remove). You need to save when you get to the last record or it won't let you do anything.</li>
            <li>Run Compliance again for the current term.</li>

        <ol>
            <li>Check <strong>SFAREGS</strong> to ensure the student is registered on the subject they have gotten an exemption in.</li>
            <li>Go to <strong>SFAALST</strong>, enter the current term (e.g., 201200) & the CRN.</li>

    <!-- Viewing Compliance Results -->
    <section id="viewing-compliance-results">
        <h2>Viewing Compliance Results</h2>
        <p>This is the process of checking a student's progress towards their award against the requirements of their program of study. Compliance processing takes the student's exam results and measures them against the requirements set up for their Program.</p>
        <p>Compliance will run as part of the GPA calculation processes (<strong>SZRWRAP</strong>) and can be viewed in Banner on <strong>SMICRLT</strong>, on broadsheets, grademailers, and is available to the student online.</p>
        <p>If a student does not meet compliance, they will not be allowed to progress or graduate. When a student does not meet compliance, their academic standing will reflect this (will not be Pass, or AP).</p>
        <h3>Viewing Compliance Results -- SMICRLT:</h3>
        <p>This form allows you to drill down through compliance information. The main window summarizes compliance results, provides a quick status of compliance, and allows you to access additional information.</p>
        <h3>Viewing General Requirements:</h3>
        <p>The fields in the top block describe the compliance request. Enter the student ID and select the request number from the list of values in the pop-up window. Check the date of the compliance request.</p>
        <p>Clicking on either the <strong>Met</strong> or <strong>Not Met</strong> buttons for <strong>General Requirements</strong> will open the Program Output Inquiry Form, where you can see the total credits displayed.</p>
        <p>To see the individual area (stage) compliance results, click on the <strong>Area</strong> button.</p>
        <p>When a student has met compliance, the credits required and credits used will be the same. When a student has not met compliance, there is a difference between the credits required and credits used.</p>
        <p>The program GPA is displayed under the <strong>Minimum program GPA</strong> (NOTE: This is <strong>not</strong> the Award/Stage GPA).</p>
        <h3>Viewing Compliance Results -- Per Area/Stage:</h3>
        <p>This will show the total overall credits earned for each area/stage.</p>
        <p>If an area/stage is passed, the <strong>Met</strong> button will be active; otherwise, the <strong>Not Met</strong> button will be active.</p>
        <p>Clicking on the active button will display the general requirements for the area and GPA for that area.</p>
        <p>If a waiver has been applied to an area, this will be displayed as <strong>WAI</strong> in the action code.</p>
        <h3>Viewing Compliance Results -- Per Area:</h3>
        <p>From the above, it can be seen that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Area 1 - student has 60 credits and has met compliance for Stage 1.</li>
            <li>Area 2 - student has 60 credits and has met compliance for Stage 2.</li>
            <li>Area 3 - student has 55 credits, has not met compliance for this area, and has not passed Stage 3. <strong>Not Met</strong> indicator.</li>
            <li>Area 4 - student has 60 credits, has met compliance for this area, and has passed Stage 4.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Clicking on the <strong>Used</strong> button will bring you into the subject(s) attached to this area that are used in compliance.</p>
        <h3>Used Subjects by Compliance:</h3>
        <p>This block displays the subjects used to calculate whether the student has met compliance.</p>
        <p>If a student has not met compliance for an area, the reason could be as listed below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Check if the total actual credits match the total amount of credits required for the area -- normally 60 credits (passed or failed) in this block.</li>
            <li>If credits do not amount to 60, it is possible that a subject the student has taken was not considered in compliance.</li>
            <li>Check if the grade is in <strong>SHACRSE</strong> (rolled).</li>
            <li>Check the APS for the course/module.</li>
            <li>If the grade in <strong>SHACRSE</strong>, the module appears on the APS, and the student is on a different catalog term (<strong>SGASTDN</strong>), then the student may need an adjustment. As the subject that isn't in compliance is not on the version of the program the student is linked to.</li>

    <section id="viewing-changing-overall-result">
        <h2>Viewing / Changing a Student's Overall Result</h2>
        <p><strong>SHAINST</strong> records the student's academic standing and not the award classification (e.g., M2, H1, PS).</p>
        <h3>Steps to Change a Student's Overall Result:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Enter Student ID and term in the key block.</li>
            <li>Ctrl & Pg Down.</li>
            <li>Record the student's original academic standing in the <strong>Combined Academic Standing</strong> field.</li>
            <li>Record the new academic standing in the <strong>End of Term Academic Standing</strong> field.</li>
            <li>You should only need to enter the following overrides:
                <ul>
                    <li>AP</li>
                    <li>CD</li>

            </li>
        </ol>
        <p><em>You should never have to enter a PS in SHAINST as the system should calculate academic standings correctly. You should never have to override an IN in SHAINST. EB (Exam Board Decision) must have an override.</em></p>
        <p>To allow the system to generate a new Academic Standing (e.g., if you had to put an IN override in for JAN), just remove the entry in the <strong>Combined Academic Standing</strong> field. The system will then override the <strong>End of Term Academic Standing</strong>.</p>
