            <h3>Reasons for Credits Missing from Broadsheet:</h3>

                <li>Has a module been registered with an incorrect CRN or are credits missing from CRN (SFAREGS)?</li>
                <li>Is compliance met (SMICRLT)? If not met, check to see how many Credits Used are missing?</li>

                <li>Has the student changed programmes at any stage (SMASARA)?</li>

                <li>By having the same module excluded twice or included twice, the credits will not be added correctly to their account. A module must have one include and one exclude to balance the credits correctly.</li>

                <h3>Award Class / Academic Standing Missing (AP / CD Students)</h3>
                <h4>Example for No Award Class / Academic Standing for AP/CD Students:</h4>
                <p>The award class / Academic Standing is missing on the stage 3 broadsheet but had a module from 2nd year which they repeat now and passed but the award class is still missing?</p>
                <p>This can be temporarily fixed to let school office print off the broadsheet but changes will need to be reverted back after they are printed:</p>

                </ol>
                <p><em>Awards class will now show on broadsheet. Advise school: It is temporarily fixed. If you would let me know when you have printed the Broadsheet off, as I need to revert the changes back on the system to ensure this student is on Ratification list for graduation. I am going to leave this ticket open so you can let me know when Broadsheets are printed?</em></p>
                <p>When school confirm they have printed broadsheets, follow same steps as above but changing back to Y3 in Attribute Code.</p>

                <li>Is compliance met /Grade is entered and rolled? (<strong>SMICRLT</strong>)</li>
                <li>Are all modules registered in (<strong>SFAREGS</strong>)? Take Screenshot of list of modules as reference.</li>
                <li>Check the student Catalog Term (<strong>SGASTDN</strong> -- Curriculum Tab -- take note of catalog term & Programme name (i.e., DK_IMILM_8_YR4).</li>
                <li>Compare the module(s) are the same from SFAREGS are listed in the Area for the students Catalog Term, you can check this in (<strong>SMAAREA</strong>)? Page down x5 (Take note of "From Term")</li>

            <p><em>If there are modules missing from list in SMAAREA compared to your list in SFAREGS & the "From Term" is dated after student Catalog Term, this means that the Programme has changed and the student does not meet compliance as they have a different Catalog Term.</em></p>

            <p>Student Year 4 General Nursing D00XXXXXX Deferred her Internship Module PLCE N8143 in 2021/2022 on the old programme code DK_NPNUR_8. Can she be registered to the Deferred CRN 76669?</p>
            <h3>Reply from O:</h3>
            <p>If the student is DX, then they are normally put on the old programme. There would have to be an agreement that the student could transfer to a whole new programme, and adjustments etc have to be done. I did one yesterday that Sinead asked me to on this programme but she said that it was agreed to allow that other student to graduate on the new programme. Basically, without proper consideration etc they can't just change a student's programme. DX and RX are always put on the "old" CRN and consequently they are on the original programme.</p>
            <h3>Confirmed from School:</h3>
            <p>They DO NOT want her to graduate on new programme but still won't let you register CRN, follow below steps:</p>
